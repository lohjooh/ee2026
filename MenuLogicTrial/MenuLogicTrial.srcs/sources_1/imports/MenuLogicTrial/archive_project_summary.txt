Section (1) - PROJECT INFORMATION
---------------------------------
Name      = MenuLogicTrial
Directory = C:/Users/prolo/Desktop/UNI WORK/Year 2/SEM 2/EE2026/Labs/Assignment/MenuLogicTrial

WARNING: Please verify the compiled library directory path for the following property in the
         current project. The path may point to an invalid location after opening this project.
